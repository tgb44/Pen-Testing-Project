## Penetration Testing Project

The purpose of the project is to exercise techniques in penetration testing and network analysis. This project includes the attack of two vulnerable machines, setting up
SEIM alerts (in Kibana) to detect malicious activity, researching defensive measures and patches to discovered vulnerabilities, and evaluating network activity through
Wireshark packet analysis. Please redirect to each of the following documents to follow the work flow of each excerise.
